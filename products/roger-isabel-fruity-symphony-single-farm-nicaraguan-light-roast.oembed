GMCG is on the ground, all the time, teaming up with producers willing to take the steps necessary to produce high-cupping Specialty Coffee. They stand (literally) on every partner farm during picking season to ensure ripeness with specialized equipment. GMCG also carries out sustainable development projects in communities, such as free computing classes for girls from coffee communities, medical assistance, microcredit, running water in schools, and educational supplies. \u003c\/span\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cspan\u003e2020 marks our 6th harvest year purchase from Gold Mountain, and we've visited their lovely area twice since our founding.
