Local pickers are trained to pick only the reddest cherries so that the farm’s crop reaches its full potential and highest level of sweetness. Extraordinary care is taken, both during wet and dry processing, to inspect all beans and ensure that only the finest, ripest coffee is exported. In addition to washed coffee, the farm has invested in special infrastructure to increase production of natural and honey process coffee, with outstanding cupping results.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eFinca Idealista invests in volcanic filters to \u003cstrong\u003eprotect the environment\u003c\/strong\u003e from run-off when coffee is washed.
